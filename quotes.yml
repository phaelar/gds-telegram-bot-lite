- My interpretation was the matrix found bugs and put them into the loop called Zion,
  eventually the memory leak'd to an unbearable extent, then matrix sent garbage collector
  Neo to collect them all. unfortunately (to matrix), Neo fell in love with one of
  the bugs Trinity (or being seduced whatsoever), and thus choosing not to end the
  loop. more unfortunately (to matrix), Agent Smith has become such a threatening
  virus impacting the system at the same time, forcing matrix to make a choice between
  the bloated loop (which did't really harm the matrix directly) and virus (which
  did harmful stuff). Neo didn't sacrifice himself as garbage collector does not die.
